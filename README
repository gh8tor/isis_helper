Simple ISIS Helper
==========

Chrome extension that adds a right-click context menu item to add professor names and ratemyprofessor.com search links to ISIS class registration
Based on the work of pvnick.
Doesn't have direct links to ratemyprofessor like the original, but instead links to a search by last name. Added more robust lookup of what semester you are registering.
Minimally tested before publically releasing - very likely contains bugs

How to use
==========
Install the chrome extension (extension.crx, or the extension directory in unpacked, debug mode). Go to isis registration. Right click and press Add professor names. Teacher names should appear in their own column as well as links to a search by last name at ratemyprofessor.com.

How it works
==========
The extension detects every section id on the registration form and looks the teacher up using a ufl.edu webservice.

This is great! Would you like a job?

I'm glad you asked. As a poor college student, I'm certainly open to doing some part-time work to make some extra income.
